                        <h3>Your dp Account</h3>
                        <p>You may need a dp Account in order to use some of our Services. You may create your own dp Account, or your dp Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using a dp Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.</p>
                        <p>To protect your dp Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your dp Account. Try not to reuse your dp Account password on third-party applications.</p>

                        <h3>Modifying and Terminating our Services</h3>
                        <p>We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.</p>
                        <p>You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. dp may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.</p>
                        <p>We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.</p>
                        <h3>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h3>

                        <p>OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER dp NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES.

WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”.</p>
                        <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.</p>
                        <h3>Liability for our Services</h3>

                        <h3>About these Terms</h3>
                        <p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</p>
                        <p>If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>
                        <p>The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and dp consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>
